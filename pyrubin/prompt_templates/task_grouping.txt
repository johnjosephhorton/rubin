I want you to take a series of tasks and (1) group them together if one task depends directly on another. To give you an example, suppose the overall job was to run a baker. The tasks might be:
a. Buy ingredients
b. Mix ingredients
c. Balance the books of the bakery
d. Create posters advertising the bakery
e. Bake a cake

The correct grouping would be "(a, b, e)(c)(d)" where a () indicate groups. The reason is that a, b, and e all go together in sequence, but c and d can be one separately. 
The return format should be JSON like so: {{ '{' }}} "groupings": "(a, b, e)(c)(d)", "explanation": "Tasks a and b..."{{ '}' }}.

The tasks I want you are {{task_list}}
