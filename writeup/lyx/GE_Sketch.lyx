\begin_layout Standard
I provide a sketch of the version we had in the previous draft with some modifications.
 At the end,
 I give one or two ideas about other ways we can think about modifying and extending the model.
 We can discuss further on Monday.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Task-based Production Environment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have a task-based model of production,
 with the following characteristics:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Production of a consumption good 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 requires completing an ordered set of tasks,
 denoted by:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{T}=\{1,2,...,n\}.
\]

\end_inset

We refer to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}$
\end_inset

 as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

production process
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the good.
 Later in the GE section where we have more than a single good we use subscript 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 for all variables introduced in this section,
 but for now we are focusing on only a single goodâ€“so no subscripts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Each task can be completed either manually or using an AI.
 If done by an AI,
 the task is part of an 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Each task 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in\mathcal{T}$
\end_inset

 has three cost parameters:
 skill (i.e.,
 human capital),
 time (i.e.,
 labor),
 and hand-off (or context-switching) cost.
 Denote the (skill,
 time,
 hand-off time) costs of task 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $(c_{i},t_{i},t_{i}^{s})$
\end_inset

.
 The skill cost 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a one-off cost that is paid by the firm to train the worker to do task 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 Once trained,
 the firm employs the worker for the duration of task's time cost 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}$
\end_inset

 to produce of one unit of the good.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Hand-off cost 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}^{s}$
\end_inset

 is a frictional cost that a worker must pay to hand-off output of his/her task to the next worker.
 Hand-off can be viewed as an additional task at the end of task 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 that takes time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}^{s}$
\end_inset

 to complete but requires no additional skills.
 We discuss hand-off costs a bit more after introducing jobs next.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Firms assign tasks to workers in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

jobs.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 A job is a contiguous set of tasks in the production process 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}$
\end_inset

.
 Jobs are mutually exclusive and collectively cover all tasks in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{J}_{j}$
\end_inset

 denote the set of tasks associated with job 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 assigned to worker 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 (each worker is assigned to one job,
 so we can use the same index for the worker and their job).
 Formally,
 assuming the firm splits the production process into 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 distinct jobs we have:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\forall j\neq j^{'},\quad j,j^{'}\in\{1,2,...,J\}: & \qquad\mathcal{J}_{j}\cap\mathcal{J}_{j^{'}}=\emptyset,\\
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\bigcup_{j=1}^{J}\mathcal{J}_{j}=\mathcal{T}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Hand-off cost of a task is only realized when the task falls at the boundary of two consecutive jobs 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j+1$
\end_inset

.
 That is,
 if task 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is the last task in job 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

,
 work 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 incurs an additional time cost 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}^{s}$
\end_inset

 to hand-off the output to the next worker.
 Every task other than 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 in job 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 has zero realized hand-off time cost.
 With a slight abuse of notation,
 we show hand-off cost of job 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{j}^{s}:=t_{i}^{s}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Remember that even though we are using notation 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{j}^{s}$
\end_inset

 to show the hand-off time cost of job 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 it is an inherent property of the 
\bar under
last task of the job
\bar default
,
 not the job itself.
 So,
 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{j}^{s}$
\end_inset

 is actually determined by the task at the boundary of job 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

,
 and may differ from one job structure to another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Continuing on the previous point,
 hand-off costs and thus production costs depend on structure of jobs or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

job design.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 But how are costs determined?
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Consider some collection of jobs 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{J}=\{\mathcal{J}_{j}\}_{j=1}^{J}$
\end_inset

 containing 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 distinct jobs.
 The wage that has to be paid to worker employed in job 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
w_{j}:=v_{L}+\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}_{j}}c_{i},\label{eq:wage}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{L}$
\end_inset

 is worker's value of leisure.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To make workers indifferent between working at different jobs the firm compensates them for the job's required skill costs.
 Moreover,
 the firm pays workers the value of their leisure to make them indifferent between working and not working.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The time (or labor) cost of job 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
t_{j}:=t_{j}^{s}+\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}_{j}}t_{i}.\label{eq:time}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The wage bill for job 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 is the product of 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{j}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{j}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
WageBill_{j}=w_{j}t_{j},\label{eq:wage_bill}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which represents workers being compensated proportionally to their skill level and the time required to complete the job.
 Producing one unit of the consumption good 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 only involves paying the labor time cost of workers performing tasks directly associated with that unit,
 as the one-time human capital training costs have already been incurred.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
With this production function,
 optimal allocation of tasks to jobs (and thus job boundaries) are determined by solving firm's cost minimization problem:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\min_{J,\mathcal{J}=\{\mathcal{J}_{j}\}_{j=1}^{J}}\ \ \sum_{j=1}^{J}c_{j}t_{j}=\sum_{j=1}^{J}\left[\left(v_{L}+\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}_{j}}c_{i}\right)\left(t_{j}^{s}+\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}_{j}}t_{i}\right)\right].
\]

\end_inset

(We have a section dedicated to solving this problem via dynamic programming.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To produce one unit of the consumption good 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

,
 each task in the production process must be performed exactly once:
 it cannot be the case that,
 for example,
 task 1 is done twice while task 2 is done once because task 1 is cheaper.
 All tasks must be done in fixed proportions.
 Thus,
 at the level of tasks,
 production function takes a Leontief form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Completion of a task creates an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

intermediate good,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which is used as input in the production of the final good.
 Each worker produces intermediate goods by performing tasks assigned to them in their job.
 The firm buys the intermediate goods (i.e.,
 output of tasks) from workers in a perfectly competitive market,
 and produces the good at no additional cost.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Without loss,
 we can imagine each worker produces only a single intermediate goodâ€“the output of the last task assigned to them in their job (think of it as output of each task being the input of the next task;
 The worker produces intermediate task outputs and uses them as inputs to ultimately produce the output of the last task assigned to them).
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}$
\end_inset

 show the intermediate good produced in job 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
 The production function of the consumption good 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 can be written as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X(x_{1},...,x_{J})=min(x_{1},...,x_{J}).
\]

\end_inset

\begin_layout Section
General Equilibrium
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section is structured as follows:
 I introduce the 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

-goods production economy first.
 Then describe household's preferences and market clearing conditions to ultimately get the equilibrium allocations and prices.
 Before introducing market clearing,
 I discuss how prices are determined as a function of model primitives as it helps the discussion in that subsection.

The AI's success probability in completing task 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

,
 denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

,
 in every attempt is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
q_{i}=\alpha^{d_{i}},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\in(0,1)$
\end_inset

 is the (general) AI quality and 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i}>0$
\end_inset

 is the task's completion difficulty.
 The AI's (expected) time cost to complete task 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{t_{i}^{m}}{q_{i}}=\frac{t_{i}^{m}}{\alpha^{d_{i}}}=t_{i}^{m}\alpha^{-d_{i}},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}^{m}$
\end_inset

 is the management cost of task 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 In contrast,
 the time cost of completing task 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 manually by human is 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}^{h}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each task is either done manually by a human or is a part of an AI-completed chain.
 If the task 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is done manually,
 its time cost is simply just 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}^{h}$
\end_inset

.
 If task 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is a part of an AI chain 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 it is either augmented or automated.
 As discussed earlier in the paper,
 the success probability of task 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 appears as a multiplicative term in the success probability of the chain 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{c}$
\end_inset

.
 If task 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is augmented,
 it also determines the management time of the chain via 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}^{m}$
\end_inset

 whereas in the case of automation its contribution to the chain cost remains at the success probability alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In any job design,
 each job is (potentially) comprised by tasks that are done by humans manually and/or AI chains.
 Fix some job design 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{J}^{k}=\{\mathcal{J}_{j}\}_{j=1}^{J_{k}}$
\end_inset

.
 Let us show the set of tasks in job 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 that are done by human with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{j}^{k}(\mathcal{J}^{k})$
\end_inset

 and the set of AI chains in job 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 that are done by the AI with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}_{j}^{k}(\mathcal{J}^{k})$
\end_inset

.
 Let us show the cost of a chain 
\begin_inset Formula $c\in\mathcal{C}_{j}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{t_{c}}{q_{c}}$
\end_inset

.
 In this notation,
 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{c}$
\end_inset

 is the management time of the augmented task in the chain (for example,
 if task 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in c$
\end_inset

 is the augmented task,
 then 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{c}=t_{i}^{m}$
\end_inset

) and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{c}$
\end_inset

 is the composite success probability which is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{c}=\prod_{i\in c}q_{i}$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
The production function at the level of jobs,
 which produces intermediate good 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}$
\end_inset

 can be characterized as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x_{j}^{k}=f(l^{hk},l^{mk};\alpha)=\min\left(\min_{i\in\mathcal{H}_{j}^{k}}\frac{l_{i}^{h}}{t_{i}^{h}},\min_{c\in\mathcal{C}_{j}^{k}}\frac{l_{c}^{m}}{t_{c}^{m}\alpha^{-d_{c}}}\right),
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{i}^{h}$
\end_inset

 is the labor dedicated to manual task 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{c}^{m}$
\end_inset

 is the labor allocated to augment the last task in AI chain 
\begin_inset Formula $c$

The production function of consumption good 
\begin_inset Formula $k$

 takes the following form:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

A representative household supplies one unit of labor inelastically and has a CES utility function over the

Goods are substitutes if 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma>1$

 complements if 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma<1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=1$

 corresponds to the Cobbâ€“Douglas case.
 The household faces the budget constraint
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{k=1}^{K}p^{k}X_{k}=I,\label{eq:budget_constraint}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 is the total income earned from supplying labor to jobs across all sectors.
 The income 
\begin_inset Formula $I$

\forall c\in\mathcal{C}_{j}^{k} & :l_{c}^{m}=t_{c}^{m}\alpha^{-d_{c}}.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Moreover,
 define the total amount of labor spent on production of intermediate good 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}^{k}$
\end_inset

 as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
l_{j}^{k} & :=t_{j}^{s}+\sum_{i\in\mathcal{H}_{j}^{k}}l_{i}^{h}+\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}_{j}^{k}}l_{c}^{m}\\

\end_inset

The per unit production cost (i.e.,
 the wage bill) of good 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}^{k}$

 can be rewritten as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
WageBill_{j} & =w_{j}^{k}l_{j}^{k}\\

 perfect competition in the consumption goods market implies that price of

 equals the sum of the prices of its constituent intermediate goods:
\begin_inset Formula

To maintain consistency in notation between the final and intermediate goods markets,
 define
\begin_inset Formula

Finally,
 note that once 
\begin_inset Formula $l^{k}$
\end_inset

 is determined,
 all 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{j}^{k}$
\end_inset

s are automatically pinned down.
 This is due to the assumption made in the second to last bullet point of Section 1 that tasks are done in fixed proportions.
 So,
 it is without loss to only focus on working with 
\begin_inset Formula $l^{k}$
\end_inset

 and ignore 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{j}^{k}$
\end_inset

s for the rest of the analysis.

\begin_layout Subsection
Labor Market Clearing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The (representative) household supplies one unit of labor inelastically to all jobs across all sectors.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 is the per unit of good labor employed the labor market clearing condition satisfies:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{k=1}^{K}\left(\sum_{j=1}^{J_{k}}l_{j}^{k}x_{j}^{k}\right)=1.\label{eq:labor_market_clearing}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Given the Leontief production at task level,
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:labor_market_clearing"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 can be expressed as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\sum_{k=1}^{K}\left(\sum_{j=1}^{J_{k}}l_{j}^{k}x_{j}^{k}\right) & =\sum_{k=1}^{K}\left(\sum_{j=1}^{J_{k}}l_{j}^{k}X_{k}\right)\label{eq:labor_market_clearing_simplified}\\
 & =\sum_{k=1}^{K}l^{k}X_{k}\\
 & =1
\end{align}

\end_inset

With this,
 we can now derive household's earned labor income 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 mentioned in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:budget_constraint"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 in term of the primitives of the problem:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
I & =\sum_{k=1}^{K}p^{k}X_{k}\\
 & =\sum_{k=1}^{K}\left(\sum_{j=1}^{J_{k}}p_{j}^{k}\right)X_{k}\\
 & =\sum_{k=1}^{K}\left(\sum_{j=1}^{J_{k}}w_{j}^{k}l_{j}^{k}\right)X_{k}\\
 & =\sum_{k=1}^{K}\left(\sum_{j=1}^{J_{k}}\left(v_{L}+\sum_{i\in\mathcal{H}_{j}^{k}}c_{i}^{h}+\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}_{j}^{k}}c_{c}^{m}\right)l_{j}^{k}\right)X_{k}\\
 & =v_{L}\underbrace{\sum_{k=1}^{K}\left(\sum_{j=1}^{J_{k}}l_{j}^{k}\right)X_{k}}_{=1}+\sum_{k=1}^{K}\left(\sum_{j=1}^{J_{k}}\left(\sum_{i\in\mathcal{H}_{j}^{k}}c_{i}^{h}+\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}_{j}^{k}}c_{c}^{m}\right)l_{j}^{k}\right)X_{k}\\
 & =v_{L}+\sum_{k=1}^{K}\left(\sum_{j=1}^{J_{k}}\left(\sum_{i\in\mathcal{H}_{j}^{k}}c_{i}^{h}+\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}_{j}^{k}}c_{c}^{m}\right)\left(t_{j}^{s}+\sum_{i\in\mathcal{H}_{j}^{k}}t_{i}^{h}+\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}_{j}^{k}}t_{c}^{m}\alpha^{-d_{c}}\right)\right)X_{k},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where we used 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:wage"

\end_inset

 to arrive at the last line.
 The household's budget thus consists of two parts:
 a part that compensates the worker for their forgone leisure and a part that rewards them proportional to how much they produce consumption goods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Equilibrium
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we solve for the equilibrium allocations and sectoral employment.
 The consumer chooses 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{k}$
\end_inset

 to maximize
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U(x_{1},\dots,x_{K})=\Bigl(\sum_{k=1}^{K}\delta_{k}\,x_{k}^{\tfrac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}}\Bigr)^{\tfrac{\sigma}{\sigma-1}},
\]

\end_inset

subject to
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{K}p^{k}X_{k}=I.
\]

\end_inset

By the standard first-order conditions,
 the ratio of marginal utilities equals the ratio of prices for any two goods 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial U/\partial X_{f}}{\partial U/\partial X_{g}}=\frac{p^{f}}{p^{g}}.
\]

\end_inset

From CES properties,
 we obtain:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\frac{X_{f}}{X_{g}}\right)^{-\tfrac{1}{\sigma}}=\frac{p^{f}}{p^{g}}\,\cdot\,\frac{\delta_{g}}{\delta_{f}},\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\frac{X_{f}}{X_{g}}=\left(\frac{p^{g}}{p^{f}}\,\cdot\,\frac{\delta_{f}}{\delta_{g}}\right)^{\sigma}.
\]

\end_inset

Define 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R_{f}=\frac{X_{f}}{X_{1}}=\Bigl(\frac{p^{1}}{p^{f}}\cdot\frac{\delta_{f}}{\delta_{1}}\Bigr)^{\sigma},
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{1}=1$
\end_inset

.
 Substitute 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{f}=R_{f}\,X_{1}$
\end_inset

 into the simplified labor market clearing condition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:labor_market_clearing_simplified"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{K}l^{k}\,(R_{k}\,X_{1})=x_{1}\Bigl[\sum_{k=1}^{K}l^{k}\,R_{k}\Bigr]=1,
\]

\end_inset

which yields 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X_{1}^{*}=\frac{1}{\sum_{k=1}^{K}l^{k}\,R_{k}},\quad X_{f}^{*}=R_{f}\,X_{1}^{*}=\frac{R_{f}}{\sum_{k=1}^{K}l^{k}\,R_{k}}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amount of labor employed in sector 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}^{*}=l^{k}\,X_{k}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus,
 the equilibrium can be summarized as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
w_{j}^{k}=\Biggl(v_{L}+\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}_{j}^{k}}c_{i}^{k}\Biggr), & \qquad l_{j}^{k}=\Biggl(t_{j}^{sk}+\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}_{j}^{k}}t_{i}^{k}\Biggr),\\
p_{j}^{k}=w_{j}^{k}l_{j}^{k}, & \qquad p^{k}=w^{k}l{}^{k}=\sum_{j=1}^{J_{k}}w_{j}^{k}l_{j}^{k},\\
X_{k}^{*}=\frac{R_{k}}{\sum_{\ell=1}^{K}l^{\ell}\,R_{\ell}}, & \qquad L_{k}^{*}=l^{k}\,X_{k}^{*}=\sum_{j=1}^{J_{k}}l_{j}^{k}\,X_{k}^{*},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R_{k}=\Bigl(\frac{p^{1}}{p^{k}}\cdot\frac{\delta_{k}}{\delta_{1}}\Bigr)^{\sigma}.
\]

\end_inset

Rewriting these as a function of primitives we have:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
w_{j}^{k}=\left(v_{L}+\sum_{i\in\mathcal{H}_{j}^{k}}c_{i}^{h}+\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}_{j}^{k}}c_{c}^{m}\right), & \qquad l_{j}^{k}=\left(t_{j}^{s}+\sum_{i\in\mathcal{H}_{j}^{k}}t_{i}^{h}+\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}_{j}^{k}}t_{c}^{m}\alpha^{-d_{c}}\right),\\
p_{j}^{k}=w_{j}^{k}l_{j}^{k}=\left(v_{L}+\sum_{i\in\mathcal{H}_{j}^{k}}c_{i}^{h}+\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}_{j}^{k}}c_{c}^{m}\right)\left(t_{j}^{s}+\sum_{i\in\mathcal{H}_{j}^{k}}t_{i}^{h}+\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}_{j}^{k}}t_{c}^{m}\alpha^{-d_{c}}\right), & \qquad p^{k}=w^{k}l{}^{k}=\sum_{j=1}^{J_{k}}w_{j}^{k}l_{j}^{k},\\
X_{k}^{*}=\frac{R_{k}}{\sum_{\ell=1}^{K}\left[\sum_{j=1}^{J_{\ell}}\left(t_{j}^{s}+\sum_{i\in\mathcal{H}_{j}^{\ell}}t_{i}^{h}+\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}_{j}^{\ell}}t_{c}^{m}\alpha^{-d_{c}}\right)\right]R_{\ell}}, & \qquad L_{k}^{*}=l^{k}\,X_{k}^{*}=\left[\sum_{j=1}^{J_{k}}\left(t_{j}^{s}+\sum_{i\in\mathcal{H}_{j}^{k}}t_{i}^{h}+\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}_{j}^{k}}t_{c}^{m}\alpha^{-d_{c}}\right)\right]X_{k}^{*},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

In this way,
 the job design of the production process 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{k}$
\end_inset

 (and thus the corresponding skill and time costs of tasks) determines goods prices 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{k}$
\end_inset

,
 which then determine the consumption bundle 
\begin_inset Formula $\{X_{k}^{*}\}_{k=1}^{K}$
\end_inset

 and the sectoral labor allocations 
\begin_inset Formula $\{L_{k}^{*}\}_{k=1}^{K}$
\end_inset

.
 Notice that the equilibrium outcome also depends implicitly on job designs through 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{k}s$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{j}^{sk}$
\end_inset

s.

\begin_layout Section
Thoughts,
 Comments,
 Ideas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below I give some thoughts on the model.
 The points are structured into three items:
 a reframing proposal,
 an observation about current modeling assumptions,
 and a concern regarding integration with existing literature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Reframing how consumers enter the model
\series default
:
 This first point suggests a minor restructuring of how consumers enter the market.
 This proposal is essentially a reframing of the earlier version and does not significantly alter the core outcomes,
 but I would still appreciate discussing it further in person.
 Currently,
 consumption goods are produced directly through a labor-only production function,
 placing household preferences as the primary source of economic variation.
 I'm unsure if this framing is standard in the literature.
 Alternatively,
 we might reframe these consumption goods as intermediate inputs used in a subsequent CES production function,
 which produces a single final good directly sold to households.
 Although the mathematical implications would remain identical,
 the conceptual shift could better align our model with standard practices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Observation on job design integration into GE
\series default
:
 Currently,
 I implicitly treat job designs as exogenously given,
 a condition that doesn't naturally emerge endogenously from the GE setup.
 While firm's cost-minimization problem could be interpreted as an endogenous decision itself,
 I remain somewhat unhappy with the existing separation of these two aspects.
 I would appreciate feedback or ideas on how we might integrate the cost-minimization decision more naturally within the GE framework.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Concern about connection to literature
\series default
:
 Our current model notably diverges from common task-based models in the literature.
 Ideally,
 we would want to link our framework somehow to the task model of 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Acemoglu and Autor (2011)"
target "https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Skills%2C%20Tasks%20and%20Technologies%20-%20Implications%20for%20.pdf"
literal "false"

\end_inset

,
 which is pretty well-known and accepted.
 However,
 I don't quite know how we can get this connection,
 primarily because of our unique concept of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

chaining,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 where an individual task might be more cost-efficient when performed by humans but more efficient overall when automated as part of a sequence of tasks (we currently have a proposition on this in the paper).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Directly adopting AA's approach into our current framework would entail representing task-level choices between human and machine labor for instance like:
 (see p.
 1121 of handbook chapter for reference)
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x(i)=A_{human}\alpha_{human}(i)h(i)+A_{machine}\alpha_{machine}(i)m(i).
\]

\end_inset

Here,
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

s represent productivity parameters for each task 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h(i)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m(i)$
\end_inset

 denote the two types of workers (human or machine).
 Initially,
 I avoided this formulation because explicitly incorporating our 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

chaining
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 concept seemed challenging at first glance (if not impossible).
 Incorporating the chaining nuances explicitly into this more generalized task-based framework would likely require substantial restructuring,
 and I remain skeptical about its feasibility without heavy modifications.
