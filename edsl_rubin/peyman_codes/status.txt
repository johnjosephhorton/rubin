As of July 25, 2024:

* Halt further exploration of DAGs
- State of DAG explorations:
	- tried multiple methods, results vary a lot but overall seem promising especially for doing a probabilistic DAG as there are multiple ways to interpret the tasks
	- have nice machinery to plot interactive graphs for comparing DAGs
- To Dos before the July 25 meeting: (left undone)
	- feed the outputs to GPT and ask it to evaluate the DAG
	- current versions are "deterministic" DAGs. Run the code a few times and get a "probabilistic" DAG where each edge appears with some probability coming from multiple runs
	- evaluate GPT response accuracy. I.e., how confident are you that an edge must be present (probably another iteration of the probabilistic approach)


During the meeting:
	- Mert --> distribution of tasks that are done on a daily or more frequent basis within each occupation + some notion of "time spent on each task" (e.g., maybe add up fraction of responses for daily and more frequent, sort, and normalize)
	- John + Brendan --> probabilistic DAGs would be more useful
	- Meet --> a notion of network similarity would be useful to see how many edges are shared between approaches (helpful for comparing different realizations of probabilistic DAGs)
	- John --> get started on doing the computation part using any DAG
	- Brendan --> two dimensions to have in mind when looking at the model:
		1) relative difference between human vs. AI efficiency in doing tasks
		2) overall quality of AI
	- John + Brendan --> try the brute forcing method first, evaluate it, then iterate from there (and Brendan will be able to help in iterations). Peyman to start with John's cost minimizing algo available in the project codes somewhere (Peyman to look it up and confirm w/ John)
